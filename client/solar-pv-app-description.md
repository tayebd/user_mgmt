#### Step 2: Array Configuration
- **Array Layout**: Series/parallel configuration, string sizing
- **Performance Parameters**: Desired system capacity, efficiency targets
- **Environmental Factors**: Temperature ranges, wind/snow loads
- **Shading Analysis**: Obstruction mapping, seasonal variations

#### Step 3: Equipment Selection
- **PV Panel Selection**: Filter by power rating, efficiency, dimensions, manufacturer
- **Inverter Selection**: Match to array configuration, consider micro-inverters vs string inverters
- **Mounting System**: Roof/wall/ground mounting, tilt adjustment options
- **Protection Devices**: Fuses, breakers, disconnect switches based on system specs
- **Cabling**: DC/AC wiring, conduit sizing, voltage drop calculations

#### Step 4: System Validation & Optimization
- **Compatibility Checks**: Panel-inverter matching, voltage/current validation
- **Performance Simulation**: Energy production estimates, ROI calculations
- **Code Compliance**: NEC/UL standards verification, local regulations
- **Safety Validation**: Grounding, overcurrent protection, clearance requirements

#### Step 5: Project Documentation & Reporting
- **Bill of Materials**: Complete equipment list with quantities and pricing
- **System Diagrams**: Single-line diagrams, wiring schematics
- **Installation Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance
- **Permitting Documentation**: Required forms and calculations
- **Financial Analysis**: Cost breakdown, payback period, incentives
