# System Architecture

## Overview

The system is designed to manage users and companies, with a focus on providing a centralized platform for data management and user interactions. The architecture follows a client-server model, where the client handles the user interface and interactions, while the server manages the backend logic, database interactions, and API endpoints.

## Components

### Client
- **Framework:** Next.js (React)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - User interface and interactions
  - State management (Redux)
  - Data fetching and caching (React Query)
  - Routing and server-side rendering

### Server
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Responsibilities:**
  - API endpoints for CRUD operations
  - Database interactions (Prisma)
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Data seeding from Excel files

### Database
- **Technology:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Data storage and management
  - Schema definition and migrations

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction:**
   - Users interact with the client-side application through the user interface.
2. **Client Requests:**
   - The client makes API requests to the server endpoints.
3. **Server Processing:**
   - The server processes these requests, interacts with the database using Prisma, and returns the necessary data.
4. **Client Response:**
   - The client receives the data and updates the user interface accordingly.

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React)
- **Backend:** Express.js
- **Database:** Prisma (PostgreSQL)
- **Data Import:** XLSX library for Excel parsing
- **Typescript:** For both frontend and backend

## Technical Constraints

- The project uses PostgreSQL as the database.
- The data seeding process relies on the structure of the provided Excel files.
- The frontend is built with Next.js, which has implications for routing and server-side rendering.
