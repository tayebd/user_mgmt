# System Patterns

## How the System is Built
The system is built using a modern web application architecture with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and user experience. The frontend is developed using React with Next.js for server-side rendering and routing. The backend is developed using Node.js with Express for RESTful API endpoints. The database operations are handled using Prisma ORM for type-safe database queries, and PostgreSQL is used for reliable data storage. Firebase is integrated for secure user authentication and management.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Frontend Framework**: React with Next.js for server-side rendering and routing.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with ShadCN components for consistent UI.
- **State Management**: Zustand for simple and efficient state handling.
- **Map Integration**: Integration with mapping services for location-based features.
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express for RESTful API endpoints.
- **Database Operations**: Prisma ORM for type-safe database queries.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL for reliable company and user data storage.
- **Authentication**: Firebase for secure user authentication and management.

## Architecture Patterns
- **Microservices Architecture**: The system is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing different components to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **RESTful API**: The backend exposes RESTful API endpoints for frontend communication.
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: The frontend is built as an SPA to provide a seamless user experience.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js is used for SSR to improve performance and SEO.
- **State Management**: Zustand is used for efficient state management in the frontend.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Firebase handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Database Management**: Prisma ORM is used for type-safe database queries and migrations.
