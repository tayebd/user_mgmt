## Critical Implementation Paths

- **User Authentication:**
  - Client: `Login.tsx`, `AuthContext.tsx`
  - Supabase
  - Server: `auth.ts` (middleware)

- **Organization Data Retrieval:**
  - Client: `OrganizationManagement.tsx`, `api.ts`
  - Server: `organizationRoutes.ts`, `organizationController.ts`
  - Prisma
  - Database

## User Preferences and Workflow

- Prefers using the command line for tasks.
- Values clear and concise documentation.

## Project-Specific Patterns

- Client-server architecture with Next.js and Express.js.
- Prisma for database interaction.
- Supabase for authentication.
- Data seeding using Excel files (`excelSeeder.ts`).

## Known Challenges

- Need to determine how to best manage and associate organization logos.

## Project Scope
- The application is a organization directory.
- Organization data is loaded from Excel files.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial database setup with migrations.
- Added Supabase authentication.
- Implemented basic organization CRUD.
- Added organization descriptions and icon URLs.

## Tool Usage Patterns

- Uses `execute_command` for running server and client commands and database operations.
- Uses `read_file` to inspect code and configuration files.
- Uses `write_to_file` and `replace_in_file` to update documentation and code.
- Uses `search_files` to find specific code patterns or implementations.
