- **Backend:** Developed using Express.js.
- **Database:** Managed using Prisma with PostgreSQL.
- **Data Import:** Utilizes the XLSX library for Excel parsing.
- **State Management:** Implements Redux for state management in the client.
- **Data Fetching:** Uses React Query for data fetching and caching.

## Constraints
- The project relies on PostgreSQL as the database.
- The data seeding process is dependent on the structure of the provided Excel files.
- The frontend is built with Next.js, which impacts routing and server-side rendering.
