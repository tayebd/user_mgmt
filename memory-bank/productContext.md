# Product Context

## Why this project exists

This project aims to provide a platform for managing users and companies, likely within a specific domain (potentially related to solar energy, given the presence of company names and icons related to solar energy in the `data/icons` directory).

## Problems it solves

- Centralized management of user and company data.
- User authentication and authorization.
- Potentially, searching and filtering of companies (based on `searchController.ts` and `searchRoutes.ts`).

## How it should work

Users should be able to:

- Log in and manage their profiles.
- View a list of companies.
- Potentially view details of individual companies.
- Search for companies.
- Depending on user roles/permissions (not yet fully defined), potentially add, edit, or delete companies and users.

## User experience goals

- Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- Fast and responsive performance.
- Secure access to data.
- Clear and informative presentation of data.
