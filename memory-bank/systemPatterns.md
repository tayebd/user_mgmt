# System Patterns

## Architecture Patterns

1. **Microservices Architecture:**
   - The application is divided into separate services for the frontend and backend, allowing for independent scaling and deployment.
   - The frontend is built with Next.js, which supports server-side rendering and static site generation.
   - The backend is built with Express.js, providing a robust API for data management.

2. **Model-View-Controller (MVC):**
   - The backend follows the MVC pattern, with models representing the data, views handling the presentation, and controllers managing the application logic.
   - The frontend uses React components to manage the view layer and Redux for state management.

3. **Data Access Object (DAO):**
   - The backend uses Prisma as the DAO to interact with the PostgreSQL database, abstracting the database operations and providing a consistent API for data access.

## Design Patterns

1. **Singleton Pattern:**
   - The Prisma client is used as a singleton to ensure a single instance of the database connection is used throughout the application.

2. **Factory Pattern:**
   - The backend uses factory methods to create instances of models and controllers, allowing for easy extension and modification.

3. **Observer Pattern:**
   - The frontend uses the Observer pattern for state management, with Redux handling the state updates and notifications.

## Technical Decisions

1. **Database Choice:**
   - PostgreSQL was chosen for its reliability, scalability, and support for complex queries.
   - Prisma was selected as the ORM for its ease of use and integration with TypeScript.

2. **Frontend Framework:**
   - Next.js was chosen for its support for server-side rendering, static site generation, and easy integration with React.

3. **Backend Framework:**
   - Express.js was chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive ecosystem of middleware.

4. **State Management:**
   - Redux was chosen for its predictability, ease of debugging, and integration with React.

5. **Data Fetching:**
   - React Query was chosen for its simplicity, performance, and integration with React.

## Component Relationships

1. **Frontend Components:**
   - The frontend is composed of reusable React components, each responsible for a specific part of the user interface.
   - Components are organized into folders based on their functionality, such as `Company` and `Project`.

2. **Wizard Components:**
   - `client/src/components/ProjectWizard/ProjectWizard.tsx`: Main wizard container component
   - `client/src/components/ProjectWizard/ProgressIndicator.tsx`: Visual progress bar component
   - `client/src/components/ProjectWizard/steps/index.ts`: Exports all step components
   - `client/src/components/ProjectWizard/steps/LocationStep.tsx`: Project location selection step
   - `client/src/components/ProjectWizard/steps/PVPanelStep.tsx`: Solar panel selection step
   - `client/src/components/ProjectWizard/steps/InverterStep.tsx`: Inverter selection step
   - `client/src/components/ProjectWizard/steps/SystemAttributesStep.tsx`: System configuration step
   - `client/src/components/ProjectWizard/steps/MiscEquipmentStep.tsx`: Additional equipment step
   - `client/src/contexts/GoogleMapsContext.tsx`: Google Maps initialization context

3. **Backend Controllers:**
   - The backend controllers handle the application logic and interact with the models and DAO to perform database operations.
   - Controllers are organized into folders based on their functionality, such as `CompanyController` and `ProjectController`.

4. **Database Models:**
   - The database models represent the data entities and their relationships.
   - Models are defined in the Prisma schema and generated as TypeScript classes.

## Data Flow

1. **Frontend to Backend:**
   - The frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints to fetch or update data.
   - The backend controllers handle the requests, interact with the models and DAO to perform database operations, and return the results to the frontend.

2. **Backend to Database:**
   - The backend controllers interact with the models and DAO to perform database operations.
   - The DAO abstracts the database operations and provides a consistent API for data access.

3. **Database to Frontend:**
   - The backend controllers return the results of database operations to the frontend.
   - The frontend updates the state and re-renders the components to reflect the changes.

## Error Handling

1. **Frontend:**
   - The frontend handles errors gracefully, displaying user-friendly messages and providing options for the user to retry or cancel the operation.

2. **Backend:**
   - The backend handles errors gracefully, logging the errors and returning user-friendly messages to the frontend.
   - The backend uses middleware to catch and handle errors, ensuring that the application remains stable and responsive.

## Security

1. **Authentication:**
   - The backend uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access the API endpoints.

2. **Authorization:**
   - The backend uses role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users can only access the data and functionality that they are authorized to use.

3. **Data Validation:**
   - The backend validates all incoming data, ensuring that it meets the expected format and constraints.
   - The frontend validates all user input, ensuring that it meets the expected format and constraints before sending it to the backend.

## Performance

1. **Caching:**
   - The frontend uses React Query to cache data, reducing the number of API requests and improving performance.

2. **Lazy Loading:**
   - The frontend uses lazy loading to load data only when it is needed, reducing the initial load time and improving performance.

3. **Code Splitting:**
   - The frontend uses code splitting to split the code into smaller chunks, reducing the initial load time and improving performance.

4. **Database Indexing:**
   - The database uses indexing to improve query performance, ensuring that the application remains fast and responsive.

## Scalability

1. **Horizontal Scaling:**
   - The application is designed to scale horizontally, allowing for the addition of more servers to handle increased load.

2. **Database Sharding:**
   - The database is designed to support sharding, allowing for the distribution of data across multiple servers to improve performance and scalability.
