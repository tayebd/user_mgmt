-   Prisma schema defined for Company, Service, Partnership, Certification, Description, Review, CompanyProject, and ProjectPhoto models.
-   Database connection established.

-   API endpoint for getting all companies.
-   Companies are displayed on the client-side `/companies` page.

## What's Left to Build

-   API endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting companies.
-   API endpoints for related models (services, partnerships, etc.).
-   UI components to display and manage company data (beyond the basic list).
-   UI components for related models.
-   User authentication and authorization.
-   Image uploading and management.
-   Deployment configuration.

## Current Status

The database seeding is complete, and the company data is displayed on the client. The next step is to implement the CRUD operations for companies and then move on to the related models.
